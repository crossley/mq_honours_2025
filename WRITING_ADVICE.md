## Kitty's questions to get you started writing an introduction

* What problem are you trying to solve?

* What is my study aiming to do to address?

* What has already been done and what do we already know?

* What is the gap in the literature?

* What is my study going to do and why does it matter?

## The Heilmeier Catechism

A powerful tool for defining your research and its value:

1. What are you trying to do? (No jargon!)
2. How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
3. What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
4. Who cares? (Why does this matter?)
5. What are the risks?
6. How much will it cost? (In your case: How feasible is it, given your time and resources?)
7. How long will it take?
8. What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?

## IMRaD Structure (Standard Scientific Writing)

| Section      | Purpose                                                   |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Introduction | What’s the question and why is it important?              |
| Methods      | What did you do to answer it?                             |
| Results      | What did you find?                                        |
| Discussion   | What does it mean? Why does it matter? What’s next?       |

## Context - Gap - Question - Approach

Use this structure to build a strong Introduction:

- Context: What’s already known?
- Gap: What’s missing or unclear?
- Question: What are you asking?
- Approach: How are you going to find out?

## One-Sentence Summary

Can you explain your project in one sentence?

Example template:
"I’m investigating X in order to understand Y, because it matters for Z."

Use this to clarify your aim and build your abstract.

## Figure-First Strategy

Before writing the Results section:

- Sketch your key figures.
- For each one: What is the main message? What should the reader learn?

## Research Question Breakdown

| Level         | Example (for a psychology thesis)                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Theoretical   | How does reward history influence attention?              |
| Empirical     | Are reaction times faster for previously rewarded stimuli?|
| Operational   | Measure RTs in a visual search task with reward cues.     |

## Reverse Outline

Once you have a draft:

- Write one sentence summarizing each paragraph.
- Use this outline to check the logic and structure of your argument.

---

## Reader Journey

Think of your reader like a user of your document:

- What should they know or feel at each stage?
- Are you motivating them, guiding them clearly, and delivering insight?
